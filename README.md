###### 01. (Ans:) A = `{}`

<p> First created a variable. Then put the value of the variable into an MT object. Since console logging will return {}</p>

###### 02. (Ans:) C = "12"

<p>I sent a function 2 arguments and gave a string and number as parameters. Later  in the console log the string and number will sit side by side.</p>

###### 03. (Ans:) C

<p>An array contains 4 strings of items. A console log of the array will show item 4 of the array.</p>

###### 04. (Ans:) B = `Hi there, undefined`

<p>A function received an argument and then returned 'hi there' did not send anything as parameter while logging console. That's why it will show up hi there and undefined</p>

###### 05. (Ans) C = '3'

<p>forEach an array will loop through each element of the array. After the condition is set and the after loop will run, the value of the count will be added one by one. console will be 3.</p>
